Efficiency Comparison: 

test case: tower(4, _ ,counts([1,2,2,4],[4,2,2,1],[1,2,2,4],[4,2,2,1])).

| ?- speedup(X).         

X = 1056.5 ? 


Ambiguous:
For the test case whose N < 4, the result will be no. 
For N = 4: 
| ?- ambiguous(4,C,T1,T2).

C = counts([4,2,2,1],[1,2,2,4],[4,2,2,1],[1,2,2,4])
T1 = [[1,2,3,4],[2,1,4,3],[3,4,1,2],[4,3,2,1]]
T2 = [[1,2,3,4],[2,4,1,3],[3,1,4,2],[4,3,2,1]] ? ;

C = counts([4,2,2,1],[1,2,2,4],[4,2,2,1],[1,2,2,4])
T1 = [[1,2,3,4],[2,4,1,3],[3,1,4,2],[4,3,2,1]]
T2 = [[1,2,3,4],[2,1,4,3],[3,4,1,2],[4,3,2,1]] ? ;

(There are many possible solutions, I didn't put all of them in this file)
